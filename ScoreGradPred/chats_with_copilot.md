Your custom dataset should be structured in a way that is compatible with the libraries and frameworks you are using. In the context of your project, it seems like you are using GluonTS and PyTorch for time series forecasting.

In GluonTS, datasets are an iterable collection of data entries, and each entry corresponds to one time series. Each entry in the iterable is a dictionary that contains at least the `start` and `target` fields. The `start` field is a timestamp that represents the start of the time series and the `target` is an array of numerical values that represents the time series values.

Here is a basic example of how a dataset could be structured:

```python
dataset = [
    {
        "start": "2022-01-01 00:00:00",
        "target": [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, ...],
        # optional fields
        "feat_static_cat": [0],
        "feat_static_real": [0.1],
        "feat_dynamic_cat": [[0, 1, 2, 3, ...]],
        "feat_dynamic_real": [[0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, ...]]
    },
    # more time series
]
```

In this example, `feat_static_cat`, `feat_static_real`, `feat_dynamic_cat`, `feat_dynamic_real` are optional fields that you can include for each time series. These fields represent categorical and real-valued static and dynamic features that you can use to enhance your model.

For PyTorch, the dataset should be wrapped in a class that extends the `torch.utils.data.Dataset` class. This class should implement the `__len__` and `__getitem__` methods. The `__getitem__` method should return a single sample from your dataset at the provided index.

Here is a basic example of how a PyTorch dataset could be structured:

```python
import torch

class MyDataset(torch.utils.data.Dataset):
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data

    def __len__(self):
        return len(self.data)

    def __getitem__(self, idx):
        return self.data[idx]
```

In this example, `data` would be a list or other collection of your data samples. Each sample should be a tuple of input and target tensors. The `__getitem__` method should return a single such sample.

Remember to preprocess your data as necessary before using it to create your dataset. This might include tasks such as normalization, handling missing values, and encoding categorical variables.
