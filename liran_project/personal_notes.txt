workflow:

1. learn how to work with time series as structured state spaces
    and learn how to run time series forecasting.
    The file state-spaces/models/s4/experiments.md examines how to run the time series forecasting with the model from
    the paper. I ran the model on the given data (state_spaces/data/informer/*)
    Unfortunately the dataset it uses comes as CSV and the repo wasnâ€™t helpful yet.
    I hope to learn more about time series as structured state spaces later on.
2. understand my dataset (icentia11k):
    - how to sample from it
    - how to plot samples
3. create subset from icentia11k dataset:
    - only Normal Sinus Rhythm (NSR) samples
4. run SSSDs4 model on my costume dataset
    - understand how to divide a time window into sample and label:
    - understand how to run the model on a batch of samples
    - understand how to evaluate the model on a batch of samples
    - understand how to plot the results
    - understand how to save the results
5. run s4 model on my costume dataset with different time windows






1. Add validation and test sets
4. Add early_stopping
5.
