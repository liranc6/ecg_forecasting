Decomposing a time series into its trend and residual components is a powerful way to analyze underlying patterns. Since you're already using predefined smoothing factors (kernels) to extract the moving average trend, it’s interesting to explore other options. 

### 1. **Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)**
FFT is a powerful tool used in signal processing to transform a time-domain signal into its frequency-domain components.

#### What is FFT?
- **FFT** stands for **Fast Fourier Transform**, which is an algorithm to compute the **Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT)** efficiently.
- In essence, it decomposes a time series into a sum of sinusoidal components (sines and cosines) at different frequencies.
- Each frequency has a corresponding **amplitude** and **phase**, showing how much of that frequency is present in the signal and how it is shifted in time.

#### How FFT Can Help:
- **Frequency Decomposition**: FFT allows you to break down your time series into different frequency components. This can help you separate high-frequency noise (residuals) from low-frequency trends.
- **Noise Filtering**: Once you know the frequency components, you can selectively remove certain frequencies (e.g., high-frequency noise) and keep others to smooth your signal further.
- **Spectral Analysis**: By analyzing the magnitude of different frequencies, you can determine dominant periodicities (seasonal effects) and even detect trends.

#### Example Use Case:
If your signal has cyclical components (such as seasonal variations or recurring patterns), FFT can help identify and filter them, leaving you with a clearer trend. It’s especially useful for periodic signals but may not always capture non-periodic or irregular trends well.

### 2. **Other Decomposition Methods**

Here are some alternative methods to decompose your time series beyond FFT and moving averages:

#### 2.1. **Wavelet Transform (WT)**
- **What is it?**: Similar to FFT, but instead of decomposing into fixed sinusoidal frequencies, wavelets decompose the signal into different scales (localized in both time and frequency).
- **When to use?**: If your signal has transient patterns or localized events (like spikes), wavelet transform can detect and decompose them more effectively than FFT, which assumes the entire signal is periodic.
- **Applications**: Detecting changes, denoising, and separating long-term trends from short-term fluctuations.

#### 2.2. **Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD)**
- **What is it?**: EMD decomposes a signal into **Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs)**, which are oscillatory modes with different frequencies and amplitudes. It's a data-driven method that doesn’t require predefined basis functions like FFT or wavelets.
- **When to use?**: EMD is great when the signal contains nonlinear and nonstationary components, meaning it can deal with irregular or complex signals that standard methods might struggle with.
- **Applications**: Trend analysis, noise removal, or extracting distinct signal modes.

#### 2.3. **Seasonal-Trend Decomposition using LOESS (STL)**
- **What is it?**: STL is a method to decompose a time series into three components: **trend**, **seasonal**, and **residual**. It uses **LOESS** (Locally Estimated Scatterplot Smoothing) to estimate each component in a flexible, nonparametric way.
- **When to use?**: STL is useful for decomposing time series with strong seasonal patterns and trends. It provides more flexibility than traditional methods like moving averages because it adjusts the smoothing dynamically.
- **Applications**: Forecasting, seasonal adjustment, trend analysis.

#### 2.4. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA) / Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)**
- **What is it?**: PCA or SVD can decompose a multivariate time series (or even a single time series represented as a matrix of lagged values) into orthogonal components or modes of variation.
- **When to use?**: If your time series is multivariate or exhibits complex interactions between different variables (e.g., multiple sensors), PCA or SVD can help isolate key trends or modes of variability.
- **Applications**: Dimensionality reduction, pattern extraction, noise filtering.

#### 2.5. **Hodrick-Prescott (HP) Filter**
- **What is it?**: The HP filter separates a time series into a **trend** and **cyclical** component by penalizing rapid changes in the trend component, which results in a smooth estimate of the underlying trend.
- **When to use?**: It’s commonly used in economics to separate long-term trends from short-term fluctuations.
- **Applications**: Trend extraction in financial and macroeconomic data.

#### 2.6. **Kalman Filtering**
- **What is it?**: A recursive filtering algorithm that estimates the hidden states of a system, often used for tracking time-varying processes.
- **When to use?**: It’s useful when you want to estimate trends in real time or when your time series is governed by underlying dynamics that evolve over time.
- **Applications**: Signal smoothing, tracking, prediction in time-varying processes.

### Summary of Methods:

| Method                 | Key Feature                                      | When to Use |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|-------------|
| **FFT**                 | Decomposes into sinusoidal components (frequency) | Periodic or oscillatory signals, frequency analysis |
| **Wavelet Transform**   | Decomposes both in time and frequency (localized) | Transient patterns or signals with localized features |
| **EMD**                 | Data-driven decomposition into oscillatory modes | Nonlinear, nonstationary signals |
| **STL**                 | Decomposes into trend, seasonal, and residuals   | Signals with strong seasonality and trends |
| **PCA/SVD**             | Finds orthogonal modes of variability            | Multivariate time series or complex patterns |
| **HP Filter**           | Smooths long-term trend, penalizing rapid changes| Economic and financial time series |
| **Kalman Filtering**    | Estimates dynamic trends recursively             | Real-time processing, noisy measurements |

### Conclusion:
FFT can help if your time series contains periodic or cyclical components, as it can identify and isolate frequencies. However, for non-periodic or more complex signals, other methods like wavelet transform, EMD, or Kalman filtering might provide more nuanced decompositions. You can even combine several methods depending on the nature of your data.

If you're unsure about the underlying patterns, **EMD** and **wavelet transform** are particularly versatile as they adapt to nonlinear and nonstationary behavior. For signals with strong seasonality, **STL** could be ideal.

### 1. **Oscillatory Modes with Different Frequencies and Amplitudes**

An **oscillatory mode** refers to a pattern in the data that repeatedly fluctuates, like waves. In the context of time series decomposition (such as with Fourier Transform, EMD, or wavelet decomposition), these oscillatory modes are components of the time series that vary over time, typically characterized by their **frequency** and **amplitude**.

- **Frequency**: This indicates **how often** a mode oscillates over a given period. Higher frequencies correspond to faster oscillations (e.g., daily temperature fluctuations), and lower frequencies correspond to slower oscillations (e.g., seasonal patterns).
  - Example: A frequency of 1 cycle per day would represent a daily oscillation, while a frequency of 1 cycle per year would represent a yearly oscillation.
  
- **Amplitude**: This refers to the **height** or **intensity** of the oscillation, indicating how much the mode contributes to the overall signal.
  - Example: In a sine wave, the amplitude would be the peak value of the wave, representing how "strong" or "significant" the oscillation is.

When we say **"oscillatory modes with different frequencies and amplitudes"**, it means that the signal is being decomposed into several components, each of which oscillates at a different rate (frequency) and has a different strength (amplitude). For instance, a time series could have a high-frequency, low-amplitude noise component, and a low-frequency, high-amplitude trend component.

#### Example:
Think of a daily temperature signal:
- The **daily fluctuation** in temperature (morning to night) could be an oscillatory mode with a **high frequency** (it repeats every day) and a moderate amplitude.
- The **seasonal variation** (summer vs. winter) would have a **lower frequency** (repeats annually) and could have a larger amplitude due to the significant difference between summer and winter temperatures.

### 2. **Difference between Trend, Seasonal, and Residual**

In time series analysis, it's common to decompose the signal into three key components: **trend**, **seasonal**, and **residual**. Each represents a different aspect of the variation in the data.

#### **Trend**
- The **trend** is the long-term movement or pattern in the data. It reflects the overall direction in which the data is moving over time, whether it’s upward, downward, or flat.
- **Characteristics**: The trend captures gradual changes over time. It smooths out short-term fluctuations and focuses on the longer-term evolution.
  - Example: The gradual increase in global average temperatures over decades due to climate change would be considered a trend.

#### **Seasonal**
- The **seasonal** component reflects **regular, repeating patterns** or cycles that occur at fixed intervals within the data. These are usually caused by external factors like the time of year, time of day, or other cyclic influences.
- **Characteristics**: Seasonal effects are periodic and repeat at known intervals (e.g., every day, every month, or every year). They have a fixed frequency.
  - Example: Retail sales might spike every December due to the holiday season, or energy usage might increase in winter and summer due to heating and cooling needs.

#### **Residual (or Irregular Component)**
- The **residual** is the remaining variation in the data after removing the trend and seasonal components. It represents the **unexplained noise or random fluctuations** that don’t follow a regular pattern.
- **Characteristics**: The residual is often considered "white noise" or random error. It includes unpredictable, non-recurring influences on the data that can’t be explained by trend or seasonality.
  - Example: Unexpected spikes in sales due to one-off events, or random fluctuations in stock prices that aren’t related to any obvious trend or seasonal factor.

### Example of Time Series Decomposition:

Consider monthly sales data for a retail store over several years:

- **Trend**: There might be a general increase in sales over the years due to business growth (long-term upward trend).
- **Seasonal**: The data may show repeating patterns, like a spike in sales every December during the holiday season (annual seasonality).
- **Residual**: There may be fluctuations in the data due to unexpected events, such as a marketing campaign in April that caused a temporary sales spike, or disruptions like a supply chain issue (residual).

### Graphical Explanation:

1. **Trend**: Imagine the line on a graph that smooths out all the little ups and downs and shows the general direction of the data (upward or downward).
2. **Seasonal**: Superimposed on the trend, you see regular peaks and troughs, like waves repeating at consistent intervals.
3. **Residual**: If you subtract the trend and seasonal patterns, what's left is the random "noise" or variations that don't follow any regular pattern.

### Summary:

- **Trend**: The long-term movement of the data.
- **Seasonal**: Regular, repeating patterns at known intervals (such as daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly).
- **Residual**: The random or unexplained component after removing trend and seasonality.

Each of these components can be analyzed separately to better understand the time series and to build more accurate models for forecasting or anomaly detection.

### 1. **Professional Elaboration of ECG Signal Decomposition**

A one-lead ECG (Electrocardiogram) is a continuous time series that records the electrical activity of the heart over time. Due to its intricate structure, it can be analyzed at multiple levels of resolution, each capturing different physiological phenomena. Let’s explore the decomposition of ECG at various scales, which helps in both diagnostic applications and automated analysis.

#### **Hierarchical Structure in ECG**

1. **High-Resolution Patterns (Rhythms)**:
   - At the highest resolution, the ECG shows cardiac rhythms, which indicate the heart's electrical pacing and how regular or irregular it is. These include **Normal Sinus Rhythm (NSR)**, **Atrial Fibrillation (AFib)**, **Ventricular Tachycardia (VT)**, and more. These rhythms represent the global behavior of the heart over time and can span seconds to minutes.
   - Rhythms are composed of repeating cycles of heartbeats, and understanding this level helps in detecting arrhythmias.

2. **Medium-Resolution Patterns (Beats)**:
   - At the next level, individual **heartbeats** are the fundamental unit of analysis. Each beat typically contains a series of waveforms that represent the electrical phases of the cardiac cycle. This pattern repeats across multiple beats but with potential variations in morphology.
   - A beat is characterized by distinct **waveforms**, such as the P wave, QRS complex, and T wave, which reflect specific events like atrial depolarization, ventricular depolarization, and ventricular repolarization, respectively.

3. **Low-Resolution Patterns (Wave Components)**:
   - Zooming further in, each heartbeat is composed of finer components:
     - **P wave**: Represents atrial depolarization.
     - **QRS complex**: A rapid, large-amplitude waveform that represents ventricular depolarization. It is often the most prominent feature in the ECG.
     - **T wave**: Represents ventricular repolarization.
   - Abnormalities in any of these waveforms provide insight into specific types of heart conditions, such as ischemia or hypertrophy.

4. **Even Finer Resolution (Subcomponents)**:
   - At the lowest resolution, within the P wave, QRS complex, and T wave, you may analyze morphological changes (such as intervals and durations) that can indicate subtle conditions like electrolyte imbalances or early signs of cardiomyopathy.

#### **Structural Similarity in ECG**
Despite the hierarchical complexity, there is a remarkable degree of regularity in ECG signals. For example:
- Every **P wave** in a healthy person’s ECG has a similar shape across beats.
- The **QRS complex** also tends to have similar morphology across beats unless there are abnormalities such as bundle branch blocks.
This similarity allows you to exploit pattern-matching and decomposition techniques, identifying recurring structures to understand the signal in a modular way.

### 2. **Choosing the Right Decomposition Method for ECG**

To capture both global patterns (like rhythms) and local features (like P waves, QRS complexes, and T waves), you need a method that can handle **multi-scale** signal analysis. Here are some suitable methods:

#### **1. Wavelet Transform (WT)**
- **Why use it?**: The **Wavelet Transform** excels at decomposing nonstationary signals like ECG, which exhibit both transient and recurring features. Wavelets can capture information at multiple resolutions, making them ideal for detecting different levels of patterns in ECG, from long-term rhythms to localized events like beats and waveforms.
- **Advantages**: Wavelets localize both in time and frequency, so you can zoom in on specific parts of the signal to detect individual P waves, QRS complexes, or anomalies.
- **Example Use**: You could use specific wavelets (e.g., Daubechies wavelets) to decompose the ECG into different levels, identifying high-frequency components (QRS complexes) separately from low-frequency components (rhythms).

#### **2. Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD)**
- **Why use it?**: **EMD** is a data-driven method that breaks down the signal into a series of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs), each representing oscillatory modes with different frequencies. EMD is well-suited for nonstationary and nonlinear data like ECG.
- **Advantages**: EMD doesn’t require predefined basis functions (like wavelets or sinusoids). It adapts to the signal, allowing you to extract rhythmic patterns and beats naturally. This flexibility is useful when the signal morphology changes over time, as with many cardiac abnormalities.
- **Example Use**: EMD could be used to isolate intrinsic oscillations like respiratory artifacts or separate noise from genuine heartbeats.

#### **3. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) or Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)**
- **Why use it?**: For multi-lead ECG signals or scenarios where the data has underlying correlation structures, **PCA** or **SVD** can reduce the dimensionality, emphasizing the most significant features of the ECG.
- **Advantages**: These methods are useful for detecting the most important variations (like heartbeats) and for identifying repeating patterns or trends that represent the main features of the ECG.
- **Example Use**: PCA could help extract heartbeat features (QRS complexes) by focusing on the most common structures, while ignoring noise or minor variations.

#### **4. Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT)**
- **Why use it?**: **STFT** allows you to analyze the frequency content of ECG signals over time. It’s particularly useful when you want to identify transitions between different heart rhythms or when arrhythmias introduce sudden frequency shifts.
- **Advantages**: STFT can reveal how the frequency composition of the signal changes over time, which is useful for detecting rhythm changes or transitions like AFib or tachycardia.
- **Example Use**: You could use STFT to track rhythm variations over time, identifying when NSR transitions into AFib.

### 3. **What if Your Model Uses a Chain of Contained Components?**

If your model decomposes the ECG signal into a **hierarchical structure**, where each level contains more expressive information than the previous one, you would need to adjust your decomposition strategy based on the needs of each stage. 

#### Decomposition Strategy in a Contained Model:

- **Global Level (Rhythms)**:
  - Use **Wavelet Transform** or **EMD** to capture the long-term, low-frequency components representing overall rhythms. These methods allow you to isolate different frequency bands that can reveal global patterns, like transitions between arrhythmias and normal rhythm.
  
- **Mid-Level (Beats)**:
  - After isolating the rhythm, you can focus on **beat detection** by looking at the medium-scale features (QRS complexes, P waves, T waves). Here, methods like **PCA** or **wavelet decomposition** at a finer resolution would be useful for extracting individual beat components and classifying them.
  
- **Local Level (Wave Components)**:
  - For even more granular decomposition (P wave, QRS, T wave), you may need a very detailed method like **EMD** or **wavelet detail coefficients** to detect the precise shapes of the waves, especially if you're dealing with abnormal beats or subtle changes in morphology (e.g., ischemia or bundle branch blocks).

#### More Expressive Elements in a Chain Model:
- As each component in your model becomes more **expressive**, you’ll need increasingly fine-grained features. Starting with high-level rhythm analysis using broad-frequency decompositions (Wavelet Transform or STFT), you then narrow down to beat patterns (QRS detection) and finally to detailed wave morphology.
- **Adaptive Decomposition**: If your model requires each level to provide more detailed insights, an adaptive method like EMD or **Wavelet Packet Decomposition** might be better, as these methods can break down the signal progressively at multiple scales.

### Summary:

1. **ECG is a complex hierarchical signal**: At different resolutions, it contains rhythms, beats, and waveforms, and each level provides crucial diagnostic information.
2. **Decomposition options**: Use **Wavelet Transform** or **EMD** for multi-scale decomposition. PCA, STFT, and SVD can help for specific tasks like noise reduction or rhythm detection.
3. **Model with chained components**: Choose a method that progressively breaks down the signal into increasingly detailed components, such as **Wavelet Transform** for high-level features and **EMD** for fine-grained analysis at lower levels.
